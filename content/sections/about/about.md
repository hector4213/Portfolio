Im a Fullstack developer based in Toronto, Ontario. I typically describe myself as a passionate developer and eager learner who loves to solve problems and scour for solutions. I'm always listening and you never know what you can learn when you keep an open mind. In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects which help me learn a lot, I tend to aim high which helps me learn many concepts and grow as a developer. In my free-time you can find me spending time with my family, watching basketball or digging through records to sample and create beats on my MPC.
